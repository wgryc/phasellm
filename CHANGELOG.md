### Fixes

- Installation for `phasellm` (i.e., default installation) includes `transformers` to avoid errors

# 0.0.12 (2023-06-30)

### New Features

### Fixes

### New Features

- All LLMs now support `temperature` setting
- All LLMs now accept `kwargs` that they pass on to their various APIs
- `phasellm.llms.swap_roles()` helper funtion where `user` and `assistant` get swapped. Extremely useful for testing/evaluations and running simulations

### Fixes

### New Features

- Demo project: "chaining workshop" -- we'll be exploring unique ways to build prompt chains soon
- Demo project: basic chatbot. Use this as a base for other projects

### Fixes

- ClaudeWrapper bug fix: appending "Assistant:" to chats by default.
- Reverted `requirements.txt` to earlier version (v0.0.5)

# 0.0.6 (2023-05-08)

_Note:_ a number of changes in this release are not backwards compatible. They contain a 'ðŸš¨' emoji by the bullet point in case you want to review.

### New Features

- Lots of new classes!
  - LLMs: added _HuggingFaceInferenceWrapper_ so you can now query models via HuggingFace
  - Data: added _ChatPrompt_ to build chat sessions with variables
  - Evaluation: added _EvaluationStream_ to make it easy to evaluate models
  - Exceptions: added _ChatStructureException_ to be called when a chat doesn't follow OpenAI's messaging requirements
- phasellm.eval has _isProperlyStructuredChat()_ to validate 

### Fixes

- ðŸš¨ Changed _fill_prompt()_ to _fill()_ so we are consistent across _Prompt_ and _ChatPrompt_ classes
- ðŸš¨ _GPT35Evaluator_ is now _GPTEvaluator_ since you can use GPT-4 as well; the evaluation approach randomizes the order in which options are presented to the LLM to avoid any bias it might have
- Fixes to _ResearchLLM_
  - _generateOverview()_ now limits examples for categorical variables to 10, though this can also be set at the top of the file to another #. Previously we'd include all possible values.
  - Making a list of categorical values in _generateOverview()_ often errored out. This has been fixed.
